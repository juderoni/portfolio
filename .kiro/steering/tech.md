# Technology Stack

## Current State
- Git version control system
- No specific build system or framework detected yet
- Project is technology-agnostic at this stage

## Build System
No build system currently configured. When adding one, consider:
- Node.js projects: `npm` or `yarn` with package.json
- Python projects: `pip` with requirements.txt or `poetry` with pyproject.toml
- Rust projects: `cargo` with Cargo.toml
- Go projects: `go mod` with go.mod

## Common Commands
Since no specific tech stack is defined yet, establish these patterns when adding tooling:

### Development
```bash
# Install dependencies (adapt based on chosen stack)
# npm install / pip install -r requirements.txt / cargo build

# Start development server
# npm run dev / python main.py / cargo run

# Run tests
# npm test / pytest / cargo test
```

### Build & Deploy
```bash
# Build for production
# npm run build / python -m build / cargo build --release

# Lint and format code
# npm run lint / black . / cargo fmt
```

## Guidelines
- Choose tools that fit the project's complexity and team size
- Prioritize widely-adopted, well-maintained tools
- Document all setup and usage commands in README.md
